You are tasked with implementing a function in NodeJS that takes an array of objects representing students and their scores, and returns the average score for each student. Each student object contains two properties: "name" (string) and "scores" (array of numbers). The average score should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Here's an example array of student objects:

const students = [
  {
    name: "Alice",
    scores: [85, 90, 92, 88, 95]
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    scores: [75, 80, 82, 78, 85]
  },
  {
    name: "Charlie",
    scores: [92, 88, 95, 90, 85]
  }
];

const output = {
  Alice: 92,
  Bob: 84,
  Charlie: 88,
};

Your task is to write a function called calculateAverageScores that takes the students array as input and returns an object containing the average score for each student.

Your function should follow these guidelines:

1. Avoid using classes and other advanced concepts. Stick to plain JavaScript.
2. Ensure that the average score is rounded to the nearest whole number.
3. Write code that solves the problem, but it can be improved in obvious ways.

Please provide your solution code below.

const calcAverage = (arr) => {
  // create a place to hold our running total
  let sum = 0;

  // loop through the array and add each element to the running total
  // sum = arr.reduction((sum, num) => {
  //   return sum + num;
  // }, 0);

  for (const num of arr) {
    sum += num;
  }

  // divide the sum of the array by the length of the array
  const average = sum / arr.length;

  // round the average
  const roundedAvg = Math.round(average);

  // return the average
  return roundedAvg;
};


const calculateAverageScores = (students) => {
  // create the output object
  const output = {};

  // loop through the students array
  for (const student of students) {
    // we have the student object (name, scores)
    // calculate the average of the student's scores
    const roundedAvg = calcAverage(student.scores);

    // update the output object
    output[student.name] = roundedAvg;
  }

  // return the output object
  return output;
};
